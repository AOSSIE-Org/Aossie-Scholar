## Aossie-Scholar web app for Aossie (GSOC 2019) By Manikaran Singh

# Aossie-Scholar

The project is related to Google Scholar profiles and metrics. Many researchers have a Google Scholar profile. 
It is used by people to see how many papers a researcher has written, how many citations they have received, their h-index, i10-index... 
But these metrics are flawed. The goal of the project would be to extract information from Google Scholar and compute better metrics about a researcher's performance.
And then display this information and metrics with more fairer stats in another website.
