# Aossie-Scholar

The project is related to Google Scholar profiles and metrics. Many researchers have a Google Scholar profile. 
It is used by people to see how many papers a researcher has written, how many citations they have received, their h-index, i10-index... 
But these metrics are flawed. The goal of the project would be to extract information from Google Scholar and compute better metrics about a researcher's performance.
And then display this information and metrics with more fairer stats in another website.

The dep branch is set to keep track of the code that has been deployed on AWS and an instance is working on NGINX with Gunirorn here- [](13.232.12.252/metrics)
